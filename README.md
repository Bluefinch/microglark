microglark
==========

_A hacky minimalistic remote pair programing editor [µGlark.io](http://micro.glark.io)_

Once on the µGlark landing page, share the url with a fellow developer and start collaborating.
When done, download the modified file to you desktop.

When everyone has closed their browser µGlark tab, the room is destroyed on the server side.
This means there is no persistence of your data on the server, because we love privacy.

Currently, [µGlark.io](http://micro.glark.io) is hosted on a micro ec2 instance, so if it lags,
please open an issue so that we scale this a bit.
