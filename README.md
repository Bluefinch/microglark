==========

_A hacky minimalistic remote pair programing editor [µGlark.io](http://micro.glark.io)_

Once on the µGlark landing page, share the url with a fellow developer and start collaborating.

When everyone has closed their browser µGlark.io tab, the room is destroyed on the server side.
This means there is no persistence of your data on the server, because we love privacy.

Currently, [µGlark.io](http://micro.glark.io) is hosted on a micro ec2 instance, so if it lags,
please tell us so that we scale this a bit.
